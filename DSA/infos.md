	- Consultations: anytime, with prior e-mail or Teams
	  communication

##Workshops:
	- Daniel Bele, p.m. comp.ing

##Module goals:
	- Learn about basic abstract data types and algorithms
	- Learn to use concrete implementations in C++
	- Reach junior programming skills in C++
	- Module is worth 6 ECTS points (roughly 30 hours / point)
		- 30 hours of lectures (15 weeks x 2 hours)
		- 30 hours of workshops (15 weeks x 2 hours)
		- 120 hours of individual work (15 weeks x 8 hours)

##Signatures:
	- 50% for lectures and 60% for practical class

##Points and grades:
	- There are 100 points available to collect:
		- Homeworks: max 6 points
		- Schoolworks: max 6 points
		- Two midterms: max 88 points
		- No oral exam
	- Grades:
		- 92.01 – 100.00 points: excellent (5)
		- 75.01 – 92.00 points: very good (4)
		- 58.01 – 75.00 points: good (3)
		- 50.01 – 58.00 points: sufficient (2)

##Learning outcomes:
	- LO1 = Determine and argue the time complexity a priori
		and a posteriori for a given algorithm derived in a
		programming language.
	- LO2 = Construct a solution using linear data structures (list,
		linked list, stack, queue) and associated algorithms.
	- LO3 = Construct a solution using hierarchical data
		structures (tree, heap, priority queue) and
		associated algorithms.
	- LO4 = Construct a solution using tree-based dictionaries
		and associated algorithms.
	- LO5 = Describe sorting and search algorithms and
		construct a solution based on sorting and search
		algorithms.
	- LO6 = Create a solution using addressing techniques and
		argue their time complexity.

##Exams:
	- Midterm exam 1 (MI1) covers LOs 1 and 2
		- After week 8
	- Midterm exam 2 (MI2) covers LOs 3, 4, 5 and 6
		- After week 15
